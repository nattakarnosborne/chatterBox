# chatterBox
Firebase Chat Roulette App 

ChatterBox is a Chat Roulette app which randomly connect users for one-to-one text and video chat.  The app was build with the MVC model, and all views was build programmatically. Itâ€™s my personal swift 3 learning journal. This app is not appropriate for the App Store due to due to user generated content. It still need the method to filtering, flag objectionable content and need a mechanism for user to block abusive users. Feel free to contribute with your own modifications.
